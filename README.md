# Project Overview

This project is a Rock Paper Scissors game bot built using Python.
The bot learns from the opponent’s previous moves and tries to predict and counter them instead of playing randomly.
This project is inspired by the freeCodeCamp Machine Learning with Python curriculum and is suitable for beginners

# Objectives
Understand how Machine Learning concepts work at a basic level

Learn how a program can learn from past data

Implement decision-making logic in Python

Build a simple AI-based game bot

# How the Bot Works (Simple Explanation)
The bot remembers the opponent’s previous moves.

It checks which move the opponent uses the most.

It plays the winning move against that choice.

If no data is available, it plays randomly.

Example:
If opponent often plays Rock, the bot will play Paper.
This is a basic form of pattern recognition, which is a key idea in Machine Learning
